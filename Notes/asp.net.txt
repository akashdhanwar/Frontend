Visual Studio .net is an IDE by Microsoft for developing .net applications(developing console, windows, web applications)
Solution is a collection of Projects. Project is collection of Items(Like Classes). View -> Solution Explorer
namespace is logical container for grouping in C# like folders. Inside it, there are classes. System contains all the classes
Program class is the default class. Console.WriteLine("Hello")
Example - namespace is surName, class is family members
Only one static void Main method, for selecting one open Solution Explorer -> Properties -> Startup Object

constructor     -   It is a special method present inside class responsible for initializing variables of the class
                    Name of constructor is same as the class name in which it is present, it is a non value returning methods
                    Its the responsibility of programmer to define constructor under his class
                    If he fails, an implicit(default) constructor without any parameters gets defined in the class by the compiler
                    Implicit defined constructors are public
                    We can also define a constructor, we then call it a explicit constructor, can be parameterless or parameterized
                    Constructor is called on Class Instance creation
                    public Test(){ // initialization }
F9 adding breakpoint, F11 to continue
